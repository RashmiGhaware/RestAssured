RequestSpecification:
In RESTful APIs, a RequestSpecification is a part of the RestAssured library, which is used to build and define the specifications for an HTTP request.
Think of it as a blueprint or template that specifies how your HTTP request should be constructed before sending it to the server.

ResponseSpecification:
When you send an HTTP request to a server (like GET, POST, etc.), the server sends back a response.
This response contains information such as status code, headers, and response body.
ResponseSpecification is a feature provided by libraries like RestAssured in Java.
It helps you define the expected properties of an HTTP response.

Response:
The Response object in RestAssured allows you to access and inspect the details of the response received from the server. This includes:
Status code: Indicates whether the request was successful (e.g., 200 for OK), or if there was an error (e.g., 404 for Not Found).
Headers: Contains metadata associated with the response, such as content type, encoding, and cookies.
Body: Contains the content of the response, which could be in JSON, XML, HTML, or plain text format.
